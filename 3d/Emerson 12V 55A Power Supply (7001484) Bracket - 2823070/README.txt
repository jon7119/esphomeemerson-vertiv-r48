Emerson 12V 55A Power Supply (7001484) Bracket by Khepri on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2823070

Summary:
Simple bracket to hold the Emerson 7001484 12V 55A power supply in place and cover the PCB connections. I've used 8AWG wire on the 12V connections and used 10mm strain reliefs to secure these.The powerswitch is connected with a 2.5x5 mm dupont connector.
